# New-Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to determine how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

- To analyze the data of Outcomes Based on Launch Date a line chart was created using launch dates and outcomes.  The line chart provides a visual allowing quick comparison of outcomes based on month.

- In order to analyze the Outcomes Based on Goals the goal data was further summarized into various dollar ranges and then a count was completed for the successful,failed and canceled projects falling within these ranges.  Percentages were then calculated using the summarized information.
   
## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-	The first challenge I faced was in using the COUNTIFS function as this was new to me.  However, in using the Excel Help function I realized that a wizard is available to assist in writing the formula.  I was then able to copy this formula down the column.  Once copied I was quickly able to update the ranges.

## Results
-	We can conclude from the line chart "Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date" that May launch dates were the most successful with December launch dates being the least successful.  The number of failed and successful outcomes were almost equal in December.

-	We can conclude from the line chart "Outcomes Based on Goals" that the percentage successful is highest when the goal is small.  Although there are successful campaigns where the goal is in excess of 10,000 the success rate is equal to those that failed.

-	The data used in the analysis is limited and does not take into consideration years which may significantly impact success; economic conditions including interest rates, jobless numbers, etc.  Additionally, the ranges used in the Outcomes Based on Goals are too large as we can see that the majority of the campaigns have goals in the range of 1,000 to 15,000.  

- Using a pivot table and chart rather than the summarized data for Outcomes Based on Goals would have allowed for filtering allowing for further insight into the data presented.
